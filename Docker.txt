What is Docker? Infrastructure provision tool
Containerization vs Virtualization

- In comparison to the traditional virtualization functionalities of hypervisors,
- Docker container eliminate the need for a separate guest os for rvrry new virtual machine

Virtualization needs a Guest OS, You can not create directly
the application as an vm, for running app you need Guest OS
- There is fixed hardware allocation (RAM, CPU, HArdDisk)

Containerization eliminated the needs of guest OS
- Performance is increase
- Dynamic Hardware assigned (their is no fixed hardware allocation)
- Docker runs on the process isolation - isolated container there is no depencese on the OS
- Docker implement a high-level API to provide lightweight container that run processes in isolation
- A Docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-tim requirements. It also ensure better maagement and simplefied portability.
- That helps developers and oprtations team in rapid deplyment of an application.

Advantages of Containerization
Installing Docker -> get.docker.com
Docker Terminologies
    - Docker Images
        - Combination of binaries /libraries which are necessary for one software application
    - Docker Container
        - When image is installed and in come into running condition, it is called container 
    - Docker Host
        - Where we installed the Docker its called docker host (Like in our local machine, cloud virtual machine, vmware machine etc...)
    - Docker Client
        - Where we run the docker commands its called an docker client (ex- gitbash, powershell, cmd etc...)

docker exec -it my_ubuntu 
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
